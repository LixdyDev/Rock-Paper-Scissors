# Rock Paper Scissors (Console Game) 🪨📄✂️

Welcome to my implementation of the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game! I built this project as part of **The Odin Project's** Foundations curriculum to practice my JavaScript fundamentals.

## 🚀 Live Demo
[Click here to play the game!](https://lixdydev.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)
*(Note: You must open your browser console to see the game output.)*

## 🎮 How to Play
Since this is a logic-focused assignment, the game runs entirely in the **Developer Console**, not on the graphical web page.

1. Open the [Live Demo](https://lixdydev.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/) (or open `index.html` locally).
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**.
3. Go to the **Console** tab.
4. The game will prompt you to enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
5. Play 5 rounds to see who wins the final score!

## 🛠️ Features
* **5-Round Game Loop:** The game automatically runs for 5 rounds.
* **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the Player vs. Computer score.
* **Input Validation:** Handles capitalization automatically (e.g., "rock", "Rock", and "ROCK" are all accepted).
* **Random Computer Choice:** The computer selects its move randomly using `Math.random()`.

## 💻 Technologies Used
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Used for all game logic, DOM interaction, and loops.
* **HTML5:** Basic structure to host the script.

## 🧠 What I Learned
This project helped me solidify my understanding of:
* Writing functions and return values.
* Using `Math.random()` to generate computer choices.
* Using `prompt()` for user input.
* Implementing `if/else` logic and comparison operators.
* Debugging with the Chrome Developer Tools.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
A huge thank you to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for their amazing curriculum. This assignment was a great way to bridge the gap between simple variables and actual game logic.
